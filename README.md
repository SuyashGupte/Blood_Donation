# Blood_Donation

This website aims to allow patients to request for blood online and notifying them of donors
and blood available at nearest blood bank. This website also allows doctors to store donorâ€™s
data online and to find suitable trends in their health conditions. It also makes users aware
of process of blood donation. Users can take an eligibility test by check whether they can
donate blood or home without any actual checkup.
